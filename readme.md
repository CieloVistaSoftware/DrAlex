Kisitu;

 Here are new instructions for you as we need to change the way we communicate via emails and or linked in.  We will create issues instead. I will then take this repository private so the outside world will not see our work.

 [How to create an issue](https://github.com/CieloVistaSoftware/DrAlex/issues/1) From now on we will only work on issues logged to this project.  That way it keeps both of us on the same page, no emails, or linked in messages.

 Each day when I start work I will look at the issues first and provide you feedback on work or start a new issue.
