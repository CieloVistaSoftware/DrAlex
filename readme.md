Kisitu;

  Hello here are some free examples for you.  They should show enough so you can decide which color combination you would like. 

  To see these files best, put them into a folder in your downloads folder e.g. DrAlex, then open visual studio code to that folder.  From there right click on the .html file and select ![openliveserver](./images/OpenLiveServer.png) If you don't have that option then you'll need to install the Live Server Plugin, go to the 

  ![extnesions](./images/Extensions.png) 
  
  And search for Live Server.

  ![liveserver](./images/LiveServer.png)

  And click install. Reboot VSCode and it should work. 
  Just right click on any html file and pick "Open with live Server"
  
## Reusable HTML Components (Updated)

The project now includes an expanded HTML partials system for better code reuse and easier maintenance:

- **Three Core Partials**: 
  - `header.html` - Site branding and theme controls
  - `navigation.html` - Main menu (separate from header for better modularity)
  - `footer.html` - Site footer with copyright and social links

- **Implementation Examples**: 
  - `partials-example.html` - Working demonstration with explanations
  - `example-js.html` - Complete page using partials
  - `new-page-template.html` - Template for creating new pages

- **Documentation**: 
  - Check `docs/partials-documentation.md` for detailed instructions
  - See `partials.md` for conceptual overview of partials

- **Mobile Responsive Design**:
  - Fully responsive layout for mobile devices
  - Mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu
  - Optimized images and typography for small screens
  - See `docs/mobile-responsiveness.md` for implementation details
