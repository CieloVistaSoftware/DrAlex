  Hello here are some free examples for you.  They should show enough so you can decide which color combination you would like. 

  To see these files best, put them into a folder in your downloads folder e.g. DrAlex, then open visual studio code to that folder.  From there right click on the .html file and select ![openliveserver](./images/OpenLiveServer.png) If you don't have that option then you'll need to install the Live Server Plugin, go to the 

  ![extnesions](./images/Extensions.png) 
  
  And search for Live Server.

  And click install. Reboot VSCode and it should work. 
  Just right click on any html file and pick "Open with live Server"
