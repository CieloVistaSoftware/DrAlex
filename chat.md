# Chat Integration and SPA Conversion Log

## July 27, 2025

- Migrated site to SPA-style navigation using `site-content.json` for all page content.
- Updated navigation to always remain on the left side, with dynamic content loading on the right.
- Modified `js/wc-site-nav.js` to use `data-section` attributes and prevent default navigation.
- Updated `index.html` to load and render sections from `site-content.json` based on nav clicks.
- Ensured the home section loads by default and all navigation is handled client-side.
- All chat and navigation-related changes, troubleshooting, and implementation steps are now tracked in this file.
