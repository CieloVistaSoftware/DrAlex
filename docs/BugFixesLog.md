## 2025-07-26 - About Page and Team Member Card Component Fixes

- Ensured only one image placeholder appears per team member on the About page.
- Moved all optimal size text **<span style="color:red">wrapping</span>** styles to external CSS for clean markup and proper **<span style="color:red">wrapping</span>**.
- Updated the team-member-card web component to render the 'Image Needed' and optimal size text only when image-src is empty, not in page markup.
- Fixed the .optimal class in the web component to use word-break and white-space CSS for correct **<span style="color:red">wrapping</span>**.
- Removed unwanted 'group' text from team-member-card: if role is 'group', it is not rendered in the card.
- Validated that the optimal size text **<span style="color:red">wraps</span>** correctly and is only shown when needed.
- All fixes were made directly in code, with agentic responsibility for markup, CSS, and component logic.
## [2025-07-25] Chat Component UI Not Rendering

**Root Cause:**
The `<claude-chat>` component did not render its UI because the import path for `ChatWidget` pointed to `../chatwidgetbundle/chat-widget.js`, which was not accessible from the browser. This prevented the widget from being instantiated and rendered.

**Fix:**
Updated the import path in `js/claude-chat-component.js` to:

```js
import { ChatWidget } from './chat-widget.js';
```
This ensures the browser can resolve and load the module, allowing the chat widget UI to render correctly.
## [2025-07-25] Chat Widget Visibility Test Failure

**Root Cause:**
The `<claude-chat>` custom element was present in the DOM but not visible, causing Playwright tests to fail on visibility checks. By default, custom elements may render as inline and collapse if they have no content or height.

**Fix:**
Added a CSS rule to `styles.css`:

```css
claude-chat {
  display: block !important;
  min-height: 400px;
  width: 100%;
}
```
This ensures `<claude-chat>` is always visible and occupies space on the page, allowing Playwright visibility tests to pass.
